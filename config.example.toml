# Add custom sites below. Each site needs:
#   - name: display name
#   - base_url: the site's homepage
#   - search_url_template: search URL with {query} placeholder
#
# The generic adapter will try to extract prices from Schema.org
# structured data (JSON-LD) on the search results page.
# This works best with sites that embed Product/Offer markup.
